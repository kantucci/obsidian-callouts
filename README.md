# obsidian-callouts
This repository contains my personal collection of custom callouts for Obsidian.
The goal is to make my notes a bit more colorful, joyful, and visually engaging.

These callouts are tailored for my own workflow, but feel free to use or tweak them to fit your style.
It's suited for anyone who wants a more playful and cozy note-taking experience in Obsidian.
